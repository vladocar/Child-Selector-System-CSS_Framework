# Child-Selector-System-CSS_Framework

Child Selector System is experimental CSS Framework that use child selectors for making multiple simple (column) grid.

This Framework has limited use and is mainly build for *teaching purposes*.

The Framework has .one to .twelve columns elastic % based columns system. Note: .eleven is deliberately canceled.

Example class .three>div{ width:33.33% }

All the nested divs inside the .three class div will become "styled" with 33,33% and they will make three column grid.

Advantages:
 * Super small ( 0,31 kb )
 * Personalized main container (%, px, em)
 * Nested columns support
 * Easy to use.
 * Reduces the amount of generated HTML to minimum

Disadvantages:
 * Limited use (You can't build column larger then 50% (1/2) )
